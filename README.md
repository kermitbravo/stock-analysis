- October seems to be a specially challenging month given that ~43% of the campaigns launched in this month failed. 

###  Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

- For everything else we can say that keeping plays on a budget between $35,000 to $44,999 turns out to be the "sweet spot" for a successful campaign.

## Summary

To compliment this analysis, we could come up with a "Box and Whisker" chart to identify outliers in our data to guide us through our decision-making process. We could also chart a histogram to identify if our dataset is skewed to the left or right to better understand if our sweet spot leans to the high or low end of our dataset.
